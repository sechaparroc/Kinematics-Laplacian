# Kinematics-Laplacian
Kinematics 2D with Laplacian deformation

Implementation of a kinematic hierarchical model in processing (2D) using laplacian deformation.

This is an implementation in Processing of kinematic hierarchical model using a skeleton composed by hierarchical relations between joints as suggested in:

Additionally it is used the Laplacian Operator to deform the vertices of the contour based on:
